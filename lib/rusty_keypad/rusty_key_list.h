/*
 * RustyKeyList Class

 * Description:
 * 
 * The key list is stored within this class. Instead of a standard matrix scan,
 * the objects scan themselves, which I found to be more logical. This approach may seem unusual,
 * but it aligns with my preference. As the structure suggests,
 * this class is implemented as a linked list, so caution is advised when working with it.
