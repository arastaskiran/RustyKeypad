 * Description:
 *
 * Welcome to the RustyKeypad library. One weekend, I was really bored,
 * so I decided to write a library for the keypad I had on hand.
 * All the existing libraries are very useful, but they didn't fully meet my needs,
 * and I found myself repeating code for many tasks. Mine isn't perfect either,
 * but it serves my purpose. Feel free to use it if it helps you,
 * and you're welcome to contribute as you wish.
